#IoT-clock
## Aspirations
I want to build a clock that connects to a simple web service and can use text to voice to tell me when my first meeting is and what the weather is like outside(do I need to put rain gear on for my bike commute). I'm currently prototyping using an arduino uno but I hope to eventually run the whole thing off of the ESP8266.
